# Glass Jars

Feeling i carried for you,
i bottled them in a glass jars

Just to make my mind sure,
you're not that much far off.

And You became myy only star,
in this lonely nights and fire.

And i can open it anytime,
to make my soul feel alive.

I remember your scars,
i bottled them in a glass jars.
